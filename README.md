Password Manager Documentation
Introduction

The Password Manager is a Python script that allows users to securely store and retrieve passwords for various platforms. It uses the Fernet encryption method for password storage, ensuring the confidentiality and security of stored passwords. This documentation provides an overview of the code structure, usage, and dependencies.
Getting Started

To use the Password Manager script, follow these steps:

    Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

    Install the cryptography library, which is required for Fernet encryption:


pip install cryptography

Open the Python script in a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE).

Run the script using the command:


    python password_manager.py

    Follow the prompts to store and retrieve passwords securely.

Code Structure

The Password Manager script consists of the following components:
1. Password Storage


def pwd_store(platform_name, password, cipher):
    # Concatenate platform name and password
    data = f"{platform_name}: {password}"

    # Encrypt the data
    encrypted_data = cipher.encrypt(data.encode())

    # Store encrypted data in a file with a newline character
    with open("Encrypted_passwords.txt", "ab") as encrypted_file:
        encrypted_file.write(encrypted_data + b"\n")  # Append newline character

This function is responsible for securely storing passwords. It takes the platform name, password, and a Fernet cipher object as input parameters. The platform name and password are concatenated and encrypted using Fernet encryption. The encrypted data is then stored in a file with each entry separated by a newline character.
2. Password Retrieval


def pwd_retrieve(cipher):
    retrieve_platform = input("Enter the name of the platform (retrieve): ").lower()  # Convert to lowercase
    retrieved_passwords = []

    # Open file and read encrypted data
    with open("Encrypted_passwords.txt", "rb") as encrypted_file:
        encrypted_data = encrypted_file.readlines()

    try:
        # Decrypt and decode the data
        decrypted_data = [cipher.decrypt(line).decode().rstrip('\n') for line in encrypted_data]

        # Iterate over stored passwords
        for password_data in decrypted_data:
            stored_platform_name, stored_password = password_data.split(": ")

            if retrieve_platform == stored_platform_name.lower():  # Compare lowercase versions
                retrieved_passwords.append(f"Platform: {stored_platform_name}, Password: {stored_password}")

        if retrieved_passwords:
            print("Password(s) Found")

        else:
            print("Platform and password not found")
    except Exception as e:
        print("Failed to retrieve password:", str(e))

    # Save retrieved passwords to a file
    with open("Retrieved_passwords.txt", "w") as retrieved_file:
        for password in retrieved_passwords:
            retrieved_file.write(password + "\n")

This function is used to retrieve passwords. It prompts the user to enter the platform name for which they want to retrieve the password. The script reads the encrypted data from the file, decrypts and decodes it using the provided cipher, and then searches for the platform name in the stored data. If a match is found, the password is retrieved and displayed.
3. Main Execution


def main():
    # Generate a key
    key = Fernet.generate_key()

    # Create a Fernet cipher object
    cipher = Fernet(key)

    num_passwords = int(input("Enter the number of passwords you want to store: "))

    for _ in range(num_passwords):
        platform_name = input("Enter the name of the platform: ")
        password = input("Enter password: ")
        pwd_store(platform_name, password, cipher)

    print("Passwords stored successfully.")

    print("Retrieving password.....")
    pwd_retrieve(cipher)

# Calling main function
main()

The main part of the script generates a Fernet key, creates a Fernet cipher object, and prompts the user to enter the number of passwords they want to store. It then iteratively collects platform names and passwords and stores them securely using the pwd_store function. After storing passwords, it initiates the password retrieval process using the pwd_retrieve function.
Usage

    Run the Python script to start the Password Manager:

    python password_manager.py

    Enter the number of passwords you want to store when prompted.

    For each password entry, enter the platform name and the corresponding password.

    After storing passwords, the script will display a message indicating successful storage.

    To retrieve a password, enter the name of the platform for which you want to retrieve the password when prompted.

    If the password is found, it will be displayed; otherwise, a message indicating that the platform and password were not found will be displayed.

    Retrieved passwords will also be saved to a file named "Retrieved_passwords.txt" for reference.

Conclusion

This documentation provides an overview of the Password Manager script, which allows you to securely store and retrieve passwords using Fernet encryption. You can customize and use this script to manage your passwords for various platforms while ensuring their confidentiality and security.
